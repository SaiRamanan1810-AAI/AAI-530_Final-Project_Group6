# AAI-530_Data-Analytics-and-IOT

### Overview: 
Effective traffic management is essential for minimizing congestion, reducing travel delays, and 
enhancing road safety in urban areas. Our project aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML) and 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-powered system to predict vehicle density at specific 
intervals. Leveraging historical traffic data and real-time inputs, this model will forecast traffic 
density and dynamically optimize wait times at intersections. The proposed system will 
contribute to smarter urban mobility, improved traffic flow, lower emissions, and an enhanced 
commuting experience. 
### IoT Application/System Description: 
Our proposed IoT application integrates ML algorithms and CNN-based video processing to 
manage and optimize traffic flow. It will predict traffic conditions in real-time, allowing traffic 
authorities to implement adaptive signal control and better manage road congestion.
