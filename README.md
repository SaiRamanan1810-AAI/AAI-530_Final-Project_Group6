# AAI-530_Data-Analytics-and-IOT

Overview: 
Effective traffic management is essential for minimizing congestion, reducing travel delays, and 
enhancing road safety in urban areas. Our project aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML) and 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-powered system to predict vehicle density at specific 
intervals. Leveraging historical traffic data and real-time inputs, this model will forecast traffic 
density and dynamically optimize wait times at intersections. The proposed system will 
contribute to smarter urban mobility, improved traffic flow, lower emissions, and an enhanced 
commuting experience. 
IoT Application/System Description: 
Our proposed IoT application integrates ML algorithms and CNN-based video processing to 
manage and optimize traffic flow. It will predict traffic conditions in real-time, allowing traffic 
authorities to implement adaptive signal control and better manage road congestion. 
● Primary Users: City traffic authorities, urban planners, and local governments will use the 
system to improve traffic safety and flow. Commuters will indirectly benefit through 
reduced travel times and improved daily commuting experiences. 
● Industry Fit: This application fits into the smart city industry, focusing on intelligent 
infrastructure for urban mobility and sustainability. It is a step toward building greener 
and more responsive cities. 
Dataset Details: 
● Source: The dataset will be sourced from Kaggle, using traffic data collected through 
traffic cameras. 
o “Kaggle Dataset Link” 
o “Kaggle Traffic Videos Data” 
● Data Collection Method: Vehicle counts are extracted from video feeds using 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
● Size: The dataset consists of approximately 60,000 records, providing a robust 
foundation for training and validation. 
● Variables: 
o DateTime: Timestamp of each observation. 
o Junction Type: Type of traffic junction (e.g., signalized or roundabout). 
o Vehicle Count: Number of vehicles detected. 
Expected Outcomes: 
The smart traffic management system will: 
1. Predict vehicle density at intersections with high accuracy. 
2. Dynamically adjust traffic signal timings to improve overall flow. 
3. Help reduce emissions by minimizing idle time and fuel wastage. 
4. Enhance urban mobility and commuter satisfaction. 
This project exemplifies the integration of IoT and ML for addressing real-world urban 
challenges and supports the vision of sustainable smart cities. Our implementation will follow 
industry standards for documentation and collaboration, leveraging GitHub for version control 
and Tableau Public for data visualization.
